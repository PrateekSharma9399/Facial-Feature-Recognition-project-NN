# Snapchat-Filter-Using-Facial-Keypoints
This Repository contains my project to apply snapchat filters to a camera feed. **Not the best filters in the world - Just an Experiment**

The model is trained using code in [this repository](https://github.com/piyush2896/Facial-Keypoints-Detection).

Dataset on which the model is trained is avilable at kaggle over [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data)
